## Details
The MITx MicroMasters Credential in Statistics and Data Science is a stand-alone certification program offered by MITx that is designed and administered by the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and supported by the MIT Office of Digital Learning (ODL).

The MITx MicroMasters credential consists of four intensive online courses providing learners with both the foundational knowledge essential to understand the methods and tools used in data science and with hands-on practice implementing and experimenting with data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms. Along with these four courses is one virtually-proctored capstone exam.

There are four online courses and a capstone exam required to complete the MITx MicroMasters credential in Statistics and Data Science.

- 6.431x Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data
- 14.310x/14.310Fx- Data Analysis in Social Science
- 18.6501x Fundamentals of Statistics
- 6.86x Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning
- capstone / exam

note that business, marketing, psychology, etc are social sciences.

## Recommandations
We strongly recommend the completion of “Multivariable Calculus” on MIT OpenCourseWare before starting any of the MITx MicroMasters credential in Statistics and Data Science courses.

To succeed in the program, learners are strongly recommended to complete coursework from Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python (6.0001) or if possible: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (6.0002).

These courses build on one another. We encourage you to take them in this order:

## Details
What are the key concepts covered in each course?   ¶
6.431x (Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data) is an introduction to probabilistic models, including random processes and the basic elements of statistical inference, and covers the foundations of data science.

14.310x (Data Analysis in Social Science) covers the methods for harnessing and analyzing data to answer questions of cultural, social, economic, and policy interest.

18.6501x (Fundamentals of Statistics) helps learners to develop a deep understanding of the principles that underpin statistical inference: estimation, hypothesis testing, and prediction.


6.86x (Machine Learning with Python) is an in-depth introduction to the field of machine learning, from linear models to deep learning and reinforcement learning, with hands-on Python projects.
- 6.431x Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data (Introduction to Probability)
- 14.310x (Data Analysis in Social Science)
- 18.6501x (Fundamentals of Statistics)
- 6.86x (Machine Learning with Python)

At your discretion, to finish in a reduced time, 14.310x (Data Analysis in Social Science) may be taken in conjunction with either 18.6501x (Fundamentals of Statistics) or 6.86x (Machine Learning with Python) as a standalone class.
